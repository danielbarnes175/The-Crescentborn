    "Fireworks blast into being as a thousand lights in a dark sky. Lights from a thousand lanterns illuminate the village and house the myriad of peoples that from dusk till dawn celebrate the yearly lunar festival." with Dissolve(2.0)
    "The old fairy tales tell that it is a mere holdover from a more storied past, where myth and legend were as true as history. But now, it is a cause for celebration as one year passes, and a new one begins." with Dissolve(2.0)
    "{size=-2}The school at the center of Praelor, an old and wizened fortress manned by the wisest and most powerful of those with magic blood in their veins plays host every year, and the same mages that in study unravel the secrets of the worlds both living and dead, tonight cast wondrous incantations and illusions to the laughter of the townsfolk. Praelor celebrates, merry and hopeful.{/size}"

    "{size=-4}But three relics of the ancient world ignore the celebrations, climbing instead to the top of the tallest tower of the near-emptied Balvor Tower. Hooded in black cloaks, they seemed to meld into the shadows, and not a soul heard or saw a single trace of their presence.{/size}"

    "In the final staircase, one hooded figure spoke to the others."

    unknown3 "Masters, let me make sure the way forward is clear."

    "The other two exchanged a glance, but nodded in agreement. \"Go,\" one of them replied."

    "Their companion disappeared around the next bend, and they didn’t speak until they heard the heavy trapdoor open. Confident they were out of earshot, the intruders talked amongst themselves in hushed tones."

    unknown "I'm still troubled."

    unknown2 "You're always troubled, Daskalos."

    "The second figure who had yet remained silent pulled back his hood, revealing a kind smile framed by long, graying black hair."

    unknown2 "He's young. It's only natural that he wants to grow."

    daskalos "It's unwise to speak our names aloud."

    "His companion chuckled quietly."

    unknown2 "You're right, of course, but knowing what's coming has made me all of a sudden... nostalgic."

    daskalos "Me too... Sotec."

    "Now Sotec laughed out loud. Even Daskalos couldn't help but smile. Once the moment had passed, Sotec looked at his companion."

    sotec "You're still concerned, I see."

    daskalos "{size=-4}Do you blame me? Our future has been growing dimmer and dimmer, and after tonight, there will only be two of us left. Finding new members has always been hard, but we can’t survive off of only myself and Jeivor. I may live until the next Ritual, but after that?{/size}"

    daskalos "One new initiate can take Jeivor’s place, but Jeivor can’t take mine. Not that I trust him to begin with."

    "Sotec placed a hand on his shoulder."

    sotec "Relax, Daska. You've got a while until the next Ritual. You'll find someone by then."

    daskalos "Hmph. I wish I shared that confidence."

    "Sotec spoke in mild surprise, absent-mindedly rubbing a hand over his shoulder."
    sotec "Ah, She's speaking. She has confidence in you too, Daska."

    "{i}Confidence isn't clairvoyance{/i}, Daskalos thought."

    daskalos "Perhaps this is why Master Vorher chose you over me. You two have been a very good fit over the years."

    "He said it with a smile, but inside his thoughts were different. {i}Still, I wish it were me instead. You would have a much clearer vision for the future than I do now.{/i}"

    "He was drawn out of his nostalgic reverie by the trapdoor opening once more."

    unknown "Masters, the tower is clear."

    sotec "Are you ready? One last night together in this world?"

    "{i}No{/i}, Daskalos thought remorsefully to himself."

    daskalos "Let's proceed."

    "The duo climbed the last steps, emerging through the now-open trap door. Balvor Tower for all its beauty was little more than just that from atop; a tower. Cold stone beneath their feet was met with yet more stone as parapets."

    "Under other circumstances, Daskalos imagined he could enjoy the view that such a height commanded. Instead, as high winds tore at his clothes, he could only lament what would come as he descended the very same tower in just a few moments."

    unknown3 "Masters."

    "The youngest companion spoke, bowing his head."

    sotec "Stand Jeivor. The Ritual doesn't require such formalities. Not between us, at least."

    jeivor "Of course."

    "{size=-4}He stood tall and removed his hood. Much younger than his compatriots, his face was still untainted by age. Had he been joined by another initiate, Daskalos wouldn’t have such fear for the future - but the hunger in Jeivor’s eyes made him nothing but uneasy.{/size}"

    daskalos "Do you have them?"

    "Daskalos removed his hood as well, and pulled back his cloak to retrieve the bundle he had tied around his waist."

    "The younger disciple pulled out a similar bundle."

    jeivor "Yes, Master."

    sotec "Daska, take these."

    "Into Daskalos' hand he pushed a smaller bundle, as well as the ring off his own finger. He then turned to his other companion and pointed at a very specific place on the ground."

    sotec "Jeivor, put yours over here."

    scene bg prologue_relics with fade
    "{size=-7}Within the bundles were a dagger's hilt - it's blade having long since rusted away - and a brooch, something women in an age long forgotten would offer as a dowry. Along with the ring, Daskalos arranged them at the three remaining cardinal directions. Jeivor had already placed his own item in the north; a circlet of pure gold.{/size}"

    sotec "Sit, Jeivor. Opposite me, just as we've practiced."

    "While they sat cross-legged facing one another, Daskalos went about drawing the necessary runes. Before long, an elaborate magic circle was beginning to take shape."

    scene bg prologue_magic_circle with fade
    jeivor "How does it... feel?"

    sotec "It isn't painful."

    "His younger compatriot shook his head."

    jeivor "No, afterwards. Can you feel her power?"

    "Daskalos paused for just a moment, waiting for Sotec's reply."

    sotec "I've almost forgotten what it feels like to be alone, but in a good way. Like a very old friend is always by my side."

    jeivor "There must be more to it."

    sotec "If there is, then no one in a very long line of Vessels has found it. I wouldn't dwell on such thoughts, Jeivor. Instead, I advise you to prepare yourself for what is to come in the next few moments. It doesn't hurt, but it pays to be focused."

    jeivor "...Very well, Master."

    sotec "Daska, is it almost time?"

    "{size=-4}Daskalos hesitated before answering. His preparations were complete, the magic circle drawn, the moon at its apex. The time was nigh; he could feel an even greater… thickness, to the air. The lines between divine and mortal were beginning to blur, as they always did when another Cycle came to pass.{/size}"

    "{i}I can't delay this. I mustn't.{/i}"

    daskalos "It is time."

    sotec "Then, Daska... Goodbye. We will see each other in the next life, of that I’m sure. But I’d like to wait a very long time before you join me, my friend."

    daskalos "I would very much like the same."

    daskalos "Now, let's begin. Jeivor, Sotec, prepare yourselves."

    "Daskalos moved to issue his final instructions of the night."

    daskalos "Jeivor, I’ve practiced the words nightly for a decade. I will handle the wording."

    jeivor "Yes, Master Daskalos."

    "Jeivor hung his head as he said it, but the way he said it... was he smiling? Daskalos' heart wasn't so sure."

    daskalos "Then, Sotec, Jeivor, My Lady. Let us begin the next chapter of this world."

    "As he spoke the memorized words and began weaving the spell that would transfer the immortal spirit of the divine into the temporary body of a mortal, he could feel the very fabric of reality reacting."

    "The moon shined brighter, the air he breathed felt richer, the wind tore harder at his clothes and hair. And while he still saw fireworks, their lights were now silent, as if sound could no longer reach them atop the Tower."

    daskalos "Sotec, current Vessel of the Goddess most high, your service is completed."

    sotec "I thank thee, my Lady. It has been an honor."

    "Sotec's eyes were closed, but his breathing was coming shallower. Standing between them, Daskalos watched as his friend began to feel the withering effects of the Ritual."

    "One life will be saved, another shortened, and another lost. Such was the Ritual of the Moon."

    "And likewise, the Goddess was using him as an intermediate - her soul would transfer from Sotec to Jeivor with himself as the guide. But to lose a god… it was irrecoverable to the mortal spirit. Akin to one’s own soul being ripped in half. This would be Sotec’s final Ritual."

    daskalos "Jeivor, future Vessel of the Goddess most high. As one’s service ends, another begins. Your servitude begins tonight. The Goddess’ spirit becomes your safekeeping, your body hers."

    jeivor "Yes, Master. Yes, Goddess."

    "Jeivor's eyes were wide open, unlike Sotec's, and a smile graced his lips."

    jeivor "I welcome thee."

    "Daskalos’ felt his heart fill with dread. Not for the last time, he wished he still had the council of his own Masters, because he feared what he’d been worried about for five long years was manifesting before him."

    "Jeivor and Sotec had no necessary words to speak, merely needing to accept the gain and loss of the Goddess’ spirit respectively, but Jeivor’s eagerness to comply was alarming."

    "Perhaps he had even let slip his last sentence by mistake out of excitement, but that did nothing to assuage Daskalo’s fears. He had witnessed three Rituals, but never had anyone been so... {i}hungry{/i} to receive the divine soul."

    "It was as if the young man didn’t understand that his life would prematurely end as a direct result of this ancient magic."

    "Jeivor wasn’t merely trying to do his part for the Goddess… Daskalos knew now that he had always been right to doubt the young man. He wasn’t altruistic enough to sacrifice himself for her sake, no. He was after her power."

    "He had never expected to oversee the Ritual that would end his old friend’s life. But neither had he ever expected to have the fate of reality itself so tenuously thrust into his hands."

    daskalos "And now... The line passes from Sotec, Master of the Order of the Moon..."

    "Daskalos gathered his courage, fearing what may come next."

    daskalos "And onwards, to the next in line."

    daskalos "To Daskalos, Master of the Order of the Moon. So shall Jeivor inherit the mantle of Master, and Daskalos the mantle of Vessel."

    sotec "Daska...?"

    jeivor "What?!"

    "Gone was the quiet arrogance, and now seething fury crossed his face."

    jeivor "Daskalos, she is {color=#f00}{i}{b}mine{/b}{/i}{/color}! {i}I{/i} am the next Vessel!"

    daskalos "Goddest, most high! Take my soul as refuge until the next Cycle!"

    jeivor "You won't take this away from me!"

    "Jeivor swayed under the influence of the magic saturating the air."

    jeivor "Your soul won't survive the Ritual!"

    daskalos "Silence, Jeivor. I am still your Master for some time."

    jeivor "You'll destroy everything! {color=#f00}{i}{b}I won't have it{/b}{/i}{/color}!"

    "Jeivor took a deep breath, and narrowed his eyes. The necklace around his neck burned bright with light as it reacted to his magic."

    jeivor "Don't worry, {i}Master{/i}. Leave reality to your student. {b}Burn away!{/b}"

    "He held out his hand, commanding flames to sprout at Daskalos' feet."

    daskalos "Begone!"

    "As Daskalos cried out, the flame was swept away by a gust of wind. The emerald ring upon his finger flaring up in response."

    daskalos "{b}Silence, Jeivor!{/b}"

    "This time, a heavy weight followed his voice, imbued with magic."

    "And so solid stone turned as if liquid, and a hand grew from the ground to cover Jeivor’s mouth, stopping any further magic."

    "Daskalos fell to one knee, already panting. He could feel the Goddess beginning to enter his soul, making it hard to breathe, as if his lungs no longer knew to draw air on their own."

    "Age put even further strain on his body, like his bones suddenly weighed twice the usual."

    "It was a vital tenant instilled into the Order that only the young can sustain the Goddess--the old simply did not have the strength."

    "The air was thick with divine magic, magic that had to container, no vessel. It was like holding smoke in one’s hands, or the memories of a dream once awoken."

    "One could keep hold for some time, but it was impossible to do so for long. There were precious few minutes between now and the completion of the Ritual where he needed to concentrate on coalescing this divine energy, on absorbing it."

    "He needed to end any interference from Jeivor immediately, before he was distracted further. Without his guidance, the Goddess would wander, unable to enter the next mortal soul."

    "Reality would shatter, with the mortal and immortal realms colliding such that nothing below the heavens would survive. The world would end as he knew it."

    "But in his haste, his spell had ended too early, the magic leaving the stone before it was fully solidified. Jeivor twisted in such a way that his mouth found room to move."

    jeivor "Turn to dust!"

    "With his next command, the stone did as he asked, and fell in a pile of soot at his feet."

    "Daskalos forced himself back to his feet, unnerved that Jeivor hardly seemed to tire at all from their duel."

    "Had he forgotten what it had been like to be young? Or was the strain of the Ritual draining him even faster than he otherwise would in such a battle?"

    "Jeivor yelled as he brandished towards the old man, and the dust at his feet swirled towards the Master. He was struck with the full-frontal attack, feeling the rock fill his mouth, his nose, blocking his airways... the Goddess was beginning to fade..."

    sotec "Disperse!"

    "The sudden cry brought forth yet another blast of winds blew the rocks clean off the tower."

    "The sitting man collapsed in a heap, looking as if he were on the verge of unconsciousness."

    sotec "Daska... {size=-10}h-hurry...{/size}"

    "Daskalos collapsed as the dust was blasted away, gasping for air. He looked up from between his hands to find Jeivor taking measured, difficult steps towards him."

    "Such an act would be beyond himself, his strength too fleeting to combat the nexus. It felt as if his own legs were made of iron."

    jeivor "Give. Me. {color=#f00}{i}{b}MY. PRIZE!{/b}{/i}{/color}"

    "Jeivor waved both hands as he yelled, and the wind suddenly stopped."

    jeivor "You squander her power! I {i}will{/i} do great things with her magic!"

    "Two almost ethereal blades began to coalesce on either side of the tower, where the wind had gathered."

    daskalos "You're blind!"

    daskalos "I was right not to trust you! You never should have been allowed into the Order!"

    jeivor "And who would the next vessel be? You?"

    jeivor "You can’t bring her through the next Cycle! There are better ways to solve this problem, more {i}permanent{/i} ways!"

    jeivor "I will have my Divinity!"

    "He brandished his hands again, and the two ethereal blades hurled themselves at Daskalos."

    "{i}There's no time!{/i} He muttered the next words under his breath, praying that with all the noise of the battle that Jeivor would not hear them."

    daskalos "{size=-10}Goddess most high, my withered soul isn’t strong enough for your holiness.{/size}"

    daskalos "{size=-10}Take not my heart for a vessel, but another! An open heart, a welcoming heart...{/size} A soul far away from here...!"

    "He let his mind wander, spreading out, feeling each and every man, mer, and beast within many a league..."

    "He fell to the ground to dodge beneath the first blade, then made a fist as the second one came soon after."

    "The stones at his feet rose up to meet it, forming a wall. It kept him alive, but shattered behind the strength of the blade. Daskalos collapsed in a heap amongst the rubble as wind exploded out in every direction, no longer confined by Jeivor’s magic."

    "The Goddess’ coalescing energy was getting harder and harder to keep in stasis between previous and next Vessel, and already he could feel himself losing her. Soon, the worlds may collide as they once did long ago--!"

    "{size=-3}Gasping, he caught one last sight of Sotec, collapsed and unmoving, before finishing his adhoc incantation. The Goddess’ soul was quickly fading, but it was still there--the last of the divine had left her old Vessel. Sotec’s service had been fulfilled. Now for him to fulfill his own.{/size}"

    "There was a soul, at the very edge of his ability to see with his mind’s eye."

    daskalos "I have found thee your next Vessel, Lady Hreinar. I... I send thee away from here!"

    "A blast of divine energy sent him flat on his back, and he heard Jeivor cry out as he staggered back as well."

    "The spirit of the Goddess, dispersed and thinly spread as it was, was no longer in their presence atop Baelor Tower. Only mere whispers of her soul remained."

    "Panting, Daskalos knew by the continued separation of the immortal and mortal realms that his improvised Ritual had worked. He had bought reality time for at least one more Cycle."

    jeivor "You... YOU! {color=#f00}{i}{b}SHE WAS MINE!{/b}{/i}{/color}"

    "With a blood curdling yell, Jeivor crossed the last few feet and grabbed Daskalos by the neck, pressing him against the wall."

    jeivor "I WILL HAVE HER! You won't ruin this again!"

    "Daskalos gasped, unable to breathe even as he grabbed at the youth’s much stronger hands. He felt a searing pain all along his body, and knew exactly what Jeivor was doing; he had already used this spell once before this very night."

    daskalos "I-I..."

    "{i}Sotec... I'm sorry... It won't be long after all...{/i}"

    "He reached out with one hand, grabbing Jeivor at random. He cast one last spell before succumbing to the darkness, hoping that he could do one last thing for the Goddess before he joined Sotec in the next life."

    "{size=-4}With a cry, Jeivor fell flat on his back, the old man somehow finding the strength to cast a final spell before his end. A long cut, quite shallow, now spread from shoulder to shoulder as blood dyed his clothes crimson. Had Daskalos cast that spell mere moments earlier, he would have lost his head.{/size}"

    "Panting from the pain, Jeivor rose to his feet. Daskalos - or what was left of him, was no more. Ashes were all that remained."

    "And the Goddess was nowhere to be found, her previous Vessel quite dead on the other side of the circle. Already, he could feel the last of her presence fading away, drawn wherever the old man had sent her."

    "Jeivor roared in frustration and pain, not caring if his voice carried over the fireworks still periodically punctuating the darkness."

    "Once his rage subsided, he looked at his situation with a calmer mind. The nexus was stabilizing, the magic in the air no longer quite so unstable."

    "The magic circle was already fading, the stone going back to what it once was earlier that night. He knew then that Daskalos had succeeded in finding the Goddess a new host."

    jeivor "But they can’t be that far..."

    "In the heat of the moment, even Daskalos wouldn’t have been able to send her more than a few leagues away. He had been greatly talented in magic, but not so talented as to carry out a Ritual, fight a battle, and feel out the greater world at the same time."

    "The old man wouldn’t have been able to send her far. He could find her. He {i}would{/i} find her."

    "He did what he could to heal his wound, irritated that the skin wouldn’t quite close. {i}Damn old man.{/i} Something about his wound was magically poisoned; he couldn’t heal it like any other injury. Just another thing to curse his name over."

    "Casting one last look at the battlefield, he knew what his next steps were. As he was, he needed speed over secrecy."

    "The Ritual had been silent, but the battle would have drawn attention. Soon, mages from the Tower would be rushing to the scene, no doubt drawn to the very powerful magic that had been unleashed that night."

    "He needed to leave before that came to pass, and the Relics and the bodies couldn’t be taken with him. At least, not as they were..."

    "The corpse was the first to go. Sotec joined his companion as a pile of dust, and the wind soon blew the remains into nothingness."

    "As for the ring, Jeivor took that alone for himself. The Vessel always wore this ring, and so too would he, the rightful Vessel, wear it as well."

    "He eyed the deeply blue sapphire nestled in its center, appreciating the beauty up close as he had always wanted to."

    "With one final touch each, the remaining three Relics turned to dust as well, their magic absorbed into the air. They weren’t gone, merely intangible. What could be done could be undone; he just needed to learn how..."
